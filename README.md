In this project I implemented smooth and flexible color change of cubes using coroutine. 

400 cubes are spawned in a square, size [20*20]. 

When you click on the "Change Colors" button, the cubes change their color one by one. The color, in which the cubes will be repainted by clicking on the button is selected randomly, one for all cubes.
 
Through the inspector are customizable:
1. interval of cubes spun;
2. Change color interval;
3. Time of color change.
